# IoT Smart Dustbin 🚮

An IoT-based **Smart Dustbin** that uses sensors and microcontrollers to automate waste management.  
The system detects the fill level of the bin and notifies users/admins, helping to maintain hygiene and promote **smart city initiatives**.

---

## 🔹 Features
- 📡 **Ultrasonic Sensor** to measure waste level inside the bin.  
- 🌐 **IoT-enabled** (using Wi-Fi module / NodeMCU / ESP8266).  
- 📲 **Real-time notifications** when the bin is full.  
- ⚡ **Low-power consumption** design.  
- 🗑️ Helps in **smart waste management** by avoiding overflow.  

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Hardware**: Ultrasonic Sensor, Arduino/NodeMCU, Servo Motor, Power Supply.  
- **Software**: Arduino IDE, Embedded C, IoT Cloud (ThingSpeak / Blynk / MQTT).  
- **Languages**: C/C++, Python (optional for data processing).  

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Ultrasonic sensor detects distance (waste level).  
2. Data is sent to microcontroller (Arduino/NodeMCU).  
3. IoT module sends data to the cloud dashboard.  
4. User receives **alerts/notifications** when the bin is nearly full.  
5. Servo motor can be used for **automatic lid opening**.
